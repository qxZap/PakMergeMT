Welcome to the paks merger.

This tool merges all modded .pak files into a single optimized package.
It is designed to improve performance and stability when using mods.

How to use it ???

Run repack.exe
Windows may say it's from an unknown publisher.
Click "More Info" → "Run Anyway" to allow it.
This step sets up the environment.

Run PakMerge_MT_....bat
Again, click "More Info" → "Run Anyway" if prompted.
This will start the merging process.

Wait for the merge to complete
When it finishes, you'll be asked to press Enter.

What does this tool do?
Motor Town uses compressed .pak files by default to save space and memory.
However, in smaller or heavily modded games, this can cause slowdowns, stuttering, or longer load times.
This tool repacks all .pak files into one uncompressed file to speed things up.

Performance improvements from testing:
🧠 +2% RAM usage
🎮 +44% more stable FPS
🎥 -10% GPU usage
⚙️ -20% CPU usage
⏱️ -41% faster loading times
🚀 -150% faster teleport loading

Always make a backup before using the tool, just in case.
